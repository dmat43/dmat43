# **Wellcome to the $$$hithole**
This is the place where I try to create stuff but fail miserably.<br/>
If you use my software, plese keep in mind these **golden rules***.<br/>
## **Golden rule no.1**
Software made by me **WON'T** be guaranteed to work under any circumstances. If the code is broken and doesn't work, then **"You're using it wrong"**.
## **Golden rule no.2**
Most of the software here will be abandoned, please don't expect updates or support.
## **Golden rule no.3**
If there is a controversy for some reason, then i'm outta there.<br/>
<br/>
##### ***Warning:** Da Rules can be ignored if the license of the published software contradicts them!!!
